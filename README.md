# [Platformer](https://sp4r0w.itch.io/platformer)

## A speedrun focused platformer, made in Godot

### Description
This is a simple platforming game remade in Godot-4. The original one was buggy and had messy code, so we remade the whole thing in Godot 4.
List of changes:
- The whole game has been recoded in GDScript, instead of C#.
- Improved code, made it less spaghetti-like.
- Game now runs in 4K, with higher quality assets.
- Levels have been tweaked a bit and also look more appealing.
- Improved menus.

The old version is available in a separate branch for archive purposes.
